# ML-Practices
In this collection of projects, I’ve practiced working with a variety of machine learning models using publicly available datasets. My goal was to get hands-on experience with different types of ML problems and understand how various algorithms perform in real-world scenarios.

Some of the models I’ve explored include K-Means Clustering, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost. These projects cover a range of tasks, from classification and clustering to working with Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Overall, these projects reflect my journey into the practical side of machine learning and my effort to apply theoretical knowledge to solve meaningful data problems.
